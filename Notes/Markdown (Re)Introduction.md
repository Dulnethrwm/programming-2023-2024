# Headings
To create headings we use hash symbols (#)
We can also create different "level" headings
To create subheadings, we use multiple hashes

## This is a subheading level 2
### This is a subheading level 3
###### Level 6 is the smallest

# Modifying Text Style
We can use asterisks to modify text style, specifically bold and italics
I want this **word** to be bold
I want this *word* to be italicized
I want this ***word*** to be both bold and italicized
***This whole sentence is emphasized***

## Aside: Escape Character
If we want to place a character that is ALREADY a keyword or **reserved character** we use the slash (/)

# Strikethrough
We can use strike through characters or words using the tilde (~)
eg:
Mr. Ubial knows how to spell (~~) neighbor(~~) neighbour

# Links
Links allow us to reference information externally
[A tool **YOU** might use](https://chat.openai.com)

[Youtube](https://Youtube.com)
[Google](https://google.com)
i use [monkey type](https:///monkeytype.com)this

# Blockquotes
Block quotes allow us to emphasize a bigger chunk pf text.
We use carets (>) to create block quotes.

e.g.
 > This is an example of a *block quote*
 > This is line two of a block quote
 >
 >This is line four of a block quote, the third one is a blank.
 
# Lists
We can create both *unordered* and *ordered* lists

## Unordered Lists
To create each point, we use asterisks with a space behind it. 
We can create a sub portion of the list by placing **TABS** before the asterisk.

## Ordered List
If there is a specific order to the elements in our list, we can create an ordered list. 

e.g.
 1. Put butter into mixing bowl
 2. Add sugar to butter (*hold shift to create a second line*)
    Both brown and granulated sugar should be added.
 3. Use the mixer

# Tables
We can organise information in tables using Markdown.
We use dashes(-) and pipes(|).

Tables in markdown require headings.

e.g.

| Name     | Age      | Sign    |
| ---      |---       | ---     |
| Bruce Wayne| 35 | Aquarius|
|Mr. Ubial |Unaging |All of them|
|Your Name | age | Sign |
|Dulneth | 15 | All of them |
